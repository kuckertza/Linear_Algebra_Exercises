    "### Hungry cats\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you work in a cat shelter, with a population of 30 cats.  We want to know if we're doing a good job keeping them fed, and so we make some observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take note each hour of which ones are hungry and which are not, and we notice that it's always true that at the end of an hour 80% of the ones that were hungry are no longer hungry.  40% of the ones that were not hungry have become hungry during the hour.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question: \n",
    "If at this very moment, 5 are hungry and 25 are not, how many cats will be hungry after an hour? \n",
    "#### Answer: \n",
    "SIf we have $H$ hungry cats and $N$ not hungry cats, then the number of hungry cats after an hour is \n",
    "$$.2 H + .4 N$$\n",
    "and the number of not hungry cats after an hour is \n",
    "$$.8 H + .6 N$$\n",
    "This looks like we did matrix multiplication:\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix}.2 & .4\\\\ .8 & .6\\end{pmatrix}\\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}{H\\\\N}\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore further\n",
    "Make the matrix $A$ from the cat problem, and explore this system for yourself.\n",
    "1. How many cats are humgry and not hungry after 2 hours?  3 hours?\n",
    "2. Apply some high powers of $A$ to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix}{5\\\\25}\\end{pmatrix}$.  What do you notice?  What does it mean?\n",
    "3. Try the same experiment with different initial values of $H$ and $N$ (but still $H+N=30$).  What happens?\n",
    "4. Try the same experiment with a different total number of cats. What happens?"
